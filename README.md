# MATH 178 Machine Learning (Lab)

Lab hours: Tuesday 1-2pm ALP 3610

Office hours: Thursday 1-2pm RH 440V 

Discussion: Tuesday/Thursday MSTB 122

*Quiz and homework schedule can be found on the Canvas page.*

You are encouraged to make friends in the class, and can work in pairs on the labs and final project. (Up to 2 per assignment) 


## Getting started
The lab portion will consist of writting code and running special function defined in various packages. To this end see the **GettingStarted.md** file to help set up all u need.


## Lab Schedule:
- Lab 1 due end of week 2
- lab 2 due end of week 4
- lab 3 due end of week 6
- lab 4 due end of week 8

Labs can be found under **/labs** folder. Solutions will be posted under **/labs-sols** the day after the deadline, *therefore no late labs are accepted*.  

## Final Project
- A 10-minute presentation/code check Friday, March 20, 8-10 am
- Final project due end of week 11

The final project should be completed in single or pairs. It is a great opportunity to apply the techniques you have learned in class to a real-world dataset.

### Project objectives 
- Prepare your selected dataset.
- Apply appropriate supervised learning techniques.
- Optionally, apply advanced techniques such as Deep Learning or Decision Trees.
- Perform model evaluation and interpret the results.
- Present your findings in a clear and organized report.

###  Dataset selection
Choose a dataset from the [UCI DATA SET](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/)

Some recommended datasets to consider:
- Iris
- Wine
- Adult (Census Income)
- Heart Disease
- Bank Marketing

### Model selection
- Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression.
- Classification Techniques: Naive Bayes, KNN, Logistic Regression, LDA, QDA, SVM.
- Resampling Methods: Cross-Validation, Bootstrapping.
- Deep Learning.
- Decision Trees and Random Forests.
- Unsupervised Learning: PCA and Clustering.

### Final Project Report guidelines

- Preparing your data: Perform exploratory data analysis, identify goal/target features to predict, and preprocess the data as needed.
- Model selection: Apply at least two models (e.g., Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, or Decision Trees) and justify your choices.
- Evaluation: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, MSE, or R-squared to evaluate your models.
- Analysis: Summarize your findings, compare the performance of your models, and provide insights.
- Report: Submit a well-documented Jupyter Notebook following PEP 8 Style guidelines.

###  Deliverables
- A Jupyter Notebook containing your code, analysis, and results.
- A presentation of less than 10 minutes delivered during the Lab.

## AI

You are encouraged to use AI creatively. Please explain how and why AI was utilized in your project.
**The final project must not be entirely written by AI.**

### Deliverables
- A Jupyter Notebook containing your code, analysis, and results.
- A pdf of containing the execution of all cells of the notebook.


### Extra resources 
- To be added as we go.
